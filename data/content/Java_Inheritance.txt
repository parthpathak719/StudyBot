Inheritance in Java
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the
properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part
of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that
are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you
can reuse methods and felds of the parent class. Moreover, you can add
new methods and felds in your current class also.
Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as
a parent-child relationship.
Why use inheritance in java
o For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
o For Code Reusability.
Terms used in Inheritance
o Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a
template or blueprint from which objects are created.
o Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It
is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.
o Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass
inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.
o Reusability: As the name specifes, reusability is a mechanism which
facilitates you to reuse the felds and methods of the existing class when you
create a new class. You can use the same felds and methods already defned
in the previous class.
The syntax of Java Inheritance
class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name
{
//methods and felds

}
The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that
derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the
functionality.
In the terminology of Java, a class which is inherited is called a parent or
superclass, and the new class is called child or subclass.
Java Inheritance Example
As displayed in the above fgure, Programmer is the subclass and Employee
is the superclass. The relationship between the two classes is Programmer
IS-A Employee. It means that Programmer is a type of Employee.
class Employee{
float salary=40000;
}
class Programmer extends Employee{
int bonus=10000;

public static void main(String args[]){
Programmer p=new Programmer();
System.out.println("Programmer salary is:"+p.salary);
System.out.println("Bonus of Programmer is:"+p.bonus);
}
}
Programmer salary is:40000.0
Bonus of programmer is:10000
In the above example, Programmer object can access the feld of own class
as well as of Employee class i.e. code reusability.
Types of inheritance in java
On the basis of class, there can be three types of inheritance in java: single,
multilevel and hierarchical.
In java programming, multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through
interface only. We will learn about interfaces later.

Note: Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class.
When one class inherits multiple classes, it is known as multiple inheritance.
For Example:

Single Inheritance Example
When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance. In the
example given below, Dog class inherits the Animal class, so there is the
single inheritance.
File: TestInheritance.java
class Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}
}
class TestInheritance{
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog d=new Dog();
d.bark();
d.eat();
}}
Output:
barking...
eating...
Multilevel Inheritance Example
When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance. As
you can see in the example given below, BabyDog class inherits the Dog
class which again inherits the Animal class, so there is a multilevel
inheritance.
File: TestInheritance2.java
class Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}
}

class Dog extends Animal{
void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}
}
class BabyDog extends Dog{
void weep(){System.out.println("weeping...");}
}
class TestInheritance2{
public static void main(String args[]){
BabyDog d=new BabyDog();
d.weep();
d.bark();
d.eat();
}}
Output:
weeping...
barking...
eating...
Hierarchical Inheritance Example
When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical
inheritance. In the example given below, Dog and Cat classes inherits the
Animal class, so there is hierarchical inheritance.
File: TestInheritance3.java
class Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}
}
class Cat extends Animal{

void meow(){System.out.println("meowing...");}
}
class TestInheritance3{
public static void main(String args[]){
Cat c=new Cat();
c.meow();
c.eat();
//c.bark();//C.T.Error
}}
Output:
meowing...
eating...
Q) Why multiple inheritance is not supported in
java?
To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is
not supported in java.
Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. The C class inherits
A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method and you call it
from child class object, there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B
class.
Since compile-time errors are better than runtime errors, Java renders
compile-time error if you inherit 2 classes. So whether you have same
method or diferent, there will be compile time error.
class A{
void msg(){System.out.println("Hello");}
}
class B{
void msg(){System.out.println("Welcome");}
}

class C extends A,B{//suppose if it were
public static void main(String args[]){
C obj=new C();
obj.msg();//Now which msg() method would be invoked?
}
}
Compile Time Error
Super Keyword in Java
The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer
immediate parent class object.
Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is
created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.
Usage of Java super Keyword
1. super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
2. super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
3. super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.
1) super is used to refer immediate parent class
instance variable.
We can use super keyword to access the data member or feld of parent
class. It is used if parent class and child class have same felds.
class Animal{
String color="white";
}
class Dog extends Animal{
String color="black";
void printColor(){

System.out.println(color);//prints color of Dog class
System.out.println(super.color);//prints color of Animal class
}
}
class TestSuper1{
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog d=new Dog();
d.printColor();
}}
Output:
black
white
In the above example, Animal and Dog both classes have a common
property color. If we print color property, it will print the color of current class
by default. To access the parent property, we need to use super keyword.
2) super can be used to invoke parent class method
The super keyword can also be used to invoke parent class method. It should
be used if subclass contains the same method as parent class. In other
words, it is used if method is overridden.
class Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating bread...");}
void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}
void work(){
super.eat();
bark();
}

}
class TestSuper2{
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog d=new Dog();
d.work();
}}
Output:
eating...
barking...
In the above example Animal and Dog both classes have eat() method if we
call eat() method from Dog class, it will call the eat() method of Dog class by
default because priority is given to local.
To call the parent class method, we need to use super keyword.
3) super is used to invoke parent class constructor.
The super keyword can also be used to invoke the parent class constructor.
Let's see a simple example:
class Animal{
Animal(){System.out.println("animal is created");}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
Dog(){
super();
System.out.println("dog is created");
}
}
class TestSuper3{
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog d=new Dog();

}}
Output:
animal is created
dog is created
Final Keyword In Java
The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. The java fnal keyword
can be used in many context. Final can be:
1. variable
2. method
3. class
The fnal keyword can be applied with the variables, a fnal variable that
have no value it is called blank fnal variable or uninitialized fnal variable. It
can be initialized in the constructor only. The blank fnal variable can be
static also which will be initialized in the static block only. We will have
detailed learning of these. Let's frst learn the basics of fnal keyword.
1) Java final variable
If you make any variable as fnal, you cannot change the value of fnal
variable(It will be constant).

Example of final variable
There is a fnal variable speedlimit, we are going to change the value of this
variable, but It can't be changed because fnal variable once assigned a
value can never be changed.
class Bike9{
final int speedlimit=90;//fnal variable
void run(){
speedlimit=400;
}
public static void main(String args[]){
Bike9 obj=new Bike9();
obj.run();
}
}//end of class
Output:Compile Time Error
2) Java final method
If you make any method as fnal, you cannot override it.
Example of final method
class Bike{
final void run(){System.out.println("running");}
}
class Honda extends Bike{
void run(){System.out.println("running safely with 100kmph");}
public static void main(String args[]){
Honda honda= new Honda();
honda.run();
}

}
Output:Compile Time Error
3) Java final class
If you make any class as fnal, you cannot extend it.
Example of final class
final class Bike{}
class Honda1 extends Bike{
void run(){System.out.println("running safely with 100kmph");}
public static void main(String args[]){
Honda1 honda= new Honda1();
honda.run();
}
}
Output:Compile Time Erro
Q) Is final method inherited?
Ans) Yes, fnal method is inherited but you cannot override it. For Example:
class Bike{
final void run(){System.out.println("running...");}
}
class Honda2 extends Bike{
public static void main(String args[]){
new Honda2().run();
}
}
Output:running...

Q) What is blank or uninitialized final variable?
A fnal variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as
blank fnal variable.
If you want to create a variable that is initialized at the time of creating
object and once initialized may not be changed, it is useful. For example PAN
CARD number of an employee.
It can be initialized only in constructor.
Example of blank final variable
class Student{
int id;
String name;
final String PAN_CARD_NUMBER;
...
}
Que) Can we initialize blank final variable?
Yes, but only in constructor. For example:
class Bike10{
final int speedlimit;//blank fnal variable
Bike10(){
speedlimit=70;
System.out.println(speedlimit);
}
public static void main(String args[]){
new Bike10();
}
}
Output: 70

static blank final variable
A static fnal variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known
as static blank fnal variable. It can be initialized only in static block.
Example of static blank final variable
class A{
static final int data;//static blank fnal variable
static{ data=50;}
public static void main(String args[]){
System.out.println(A.data);
}
}
Q) What is final parameter?
If you declare any parameter as fnal, you cannot change the value of it.
class Bike11{
int cube(final int n){
n=n+2;//can't be changed as n is fnal
n*n*n;
}
public static void main(String args[]){
Bike11 b=new Bike11();
b.cube(5);
}
}
Output: Compile Time Error
Q) Can we declare a constructor final?
No, because constructor is never inherited.
